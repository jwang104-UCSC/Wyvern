# Wyvern

Wyvern is a top-down shoot em up written in Javascript, using the Phaser framework. 

This is a project for our mobile apps class. It is ported over to Android using Cordova.

One could run it on PC if `debug.html` is used instead of `index.html`.

The files were taken right from Andriod Studio, hence the chain of directories and the `.gitignore`.
